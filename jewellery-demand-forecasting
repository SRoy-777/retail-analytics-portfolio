Project Overview

This case study documents a retail demand forecasting system designed to support inventory planning and decision-making in a jewellery retail context.

Jewellery demand is influenced by strong seasonality, price fluctuations, festive cycles, and product-specific buying behavior, making naive forecasting unreliable.
The goal of this project was to design a robust, explainable, and production-ready forecasting framework that balances accuracy with business trust.

🎯 Business Problem

Retail jewellery organizations often face:

Excess inventory due to over-forecasting

Lost sales from stock-outs caused by under-forecasting

Low confidence in automated forecasts among decision-makers

The challenge was not just to predict demand, but to build a system where forecasts are interpretable, defensible, and usable by the business.

🧾 Data Overview (Anonymized)

The forecasting framework operates on aggregated retail sales data with the following characteristics:

Time-series sales at monthly granularities

Product attributes such as category and weight range

Historical demand spanning multiple years

Natural data sparsity for long-tail products

All schemas and values are anonymized. This project focuses on analytical logic, not raw data exposure.

🏗️ Forecasting System Design

The forecasting solution was designed as a rule-aware modeling framework rather than a single black-box model.

Key Design Principles

Forecasts must be explainable to business stakeholders

Model performance must be benchmarked against simple baselines

Sparse or unstable demand should not be over-modeled

Each product segment may require different treatment

🔧 Feature Engineering Strategy

Feature creation was driven by retail demand behavior rather than generic time-series templates.

Key approaches included:

Lag-based demand indicators

Rolling trend and momentum features

Seasonality signals aligned to retail buying cycles

Product-level aggregation to control noise

Feature generation logic adapts per product group to support both stable and erratic demand patterns.

📊 Modeling & Strategy (High-Level)

Instead of enforcing a single global approach, the system:

Evaluates demand behavior at product or sub-category levels

Applies modeling selectively where signal strength exists

Compares model forecasts against baseline expectations

Falls back to rules or averages when models underperform

This ensures stability over aggressive accuracy chasing.

✅ Validation & Reliability Checks

To control risk and avoid overfitting:

Forecasts are validated using rolling, time-aware splits

Model performance is evaluated relative to baselines

Degrading or unstable models are automatically rejected

Forecasts prioritize consistency over short-term gains

This validation-first mindset improves business confidence.

🔁 Handling Long-Tail & Sparse Demand

Jewellery assortments naturally include low-volume items.

The framework explicitly:

Detects sparse or intermittent demand

Avoids forcing complex models on weak signals

Uses conservative baselines where appropriate

Preserves forecast sanity in edge cases

This design prevents misleading precision.

📈 Outputs & Usage

The system produces:

Forward-looking demand estimates by product segment

Forecast vs actual comparisons for monitoring

Aggregate demand views for planning decisions

Forecast outputs are structured to integrate directly with reporting and BI layers.

🧠 Key Learnings

In retail, forecast trust matters as much as forecast accuracy

Not every SKU should be modeled the same way

Baselines are a strength, not a fallback failure

Systems outperform standalone models

🚀 Business Value

Reduced inventory planning uncertainty

Improved transparency in demand expectations

Practical forecasts aligned with managerial intuition

A scalable framework adaptable to other retail domains
