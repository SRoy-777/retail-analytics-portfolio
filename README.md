📌 Overview

This repository contains end-to-end analytics case studies built around real-world retail business problems.
The projects focus on converting raw transactional data into forecast-driven decisions, actionable customer insights, and management-ready dashboards.

All case studies emphasize:

Business understanding before modeling

Practical constraints of retail analytics

Explainability and decision usability over academic complexity

Note: All datasets, structures, and outputs are anonymized. Logic and methodology reflect real-world implementations.
